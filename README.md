# ProBet, CS353 Database Systems Term Project

ProBet is a web based social betting application. It has got all the functionalities
which most traditional betting websites have and in addition to that the site is
also a social platform for betting. In this project, a betting platform with social network features is designed. Users
 are able to bet on football and basketball matches by combining them on a bet slip,
follow/friend other users, like and comment on their bets. Additional to reasonable attributes,
a match has an attribute called minimum bet number that indicates the least
number of bets that are in a bet slip if a user wants to bet on that match.
